## Project Description
This project aims to analyze the [Red Wine Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) <br>
dataset from kaggle, understanding and identifying factors that influence 
wine <br> quality. 

### Context
The dataset includes 12 columns. 11 are input variables, features that help 
<br> describe the wine. 1 is the output variable, where the wine receives a<br>
score from 0 to 10.

### Objectives
Identify which variable influences perceived wine quality the most by<br>
fitting a statistical model, with an explanatory model approach.

### Results
Alcohol has the largest impact on the dependent variable, with a coefficient
 <br>
 of 0.97. So replying to the initial hypothesis, alcohol is the most <br>
influential factor for red wine quality.
