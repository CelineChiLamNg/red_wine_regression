## Project Description
This project aims to analyze the [Red Wine Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) <br>
dataset from kaggle, understanding and identifying factors that influence 
wine <br> quality. 

### Context

<br> describe the wine. 1 is the output variable, where the wine receives a<br>
score from 0 to 10.

### Objectives

fitting a statistical model, with an explanatory model approach.
